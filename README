Simple PostScript generator module for Perl

Matthew Newton
Version 0.01_1

This is the initial release of a module to create simple PostScript documents
using Perl. Features include:

  Generation of multi-page PostScript files
  Generation of single-page EPS files
  Creating lines/circles etc.
  Rectangles and boxes
  Text
  Colour
  Pre-defined paper sizes
  Etc. etc.

A module that provides compatibility with the GD module calls might also one day
be written, so that programs may be easily be converted to produce PostScript.
Don't hold your breath.

A test file (test.pl) is included that gives some example of how it is used.

Apologies for the lack of a Makefile.PL, but I haven't got a clue how to make it
work properly yet, and haven't had the time to work it out.

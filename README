PostScript::Simple
==================

INTRODUCTION

PostScript::Simple allows you to have a simple method of writing PostScript
files from Perl. It has several graphics primitives that allow lines, circles,
polygons and boxes to be drawn. Text can be added to the page using standard
PostScript fonts.

It is named PostScript::Simple because it is intended to be simple
to use to generate PostScript pages from Perl, not because it is a
simplified interface for some other module, or can't do advanced
things.

Features include:

    Generation of multi-page PostScript files
    Generation of single-page EPS files
    Creating lines/circles etc.
    Rectangles and boxes
    Text
    Colour
    Pre-defined paper sizes
    Etc. etc.

The file examples/example.pl provides some bad examples of what this module
does.

PostScript/Simple version 0.05
==============================

PostScript::Simple allows you to have a simple method of writing PostScript
files from Perl. It has several graphics primitives that allow lines, circles,
polygons and boxes to be drawn. Text can be added to the page using standard
PostScript fonts.

Features include:

    Generation of multi-page PostScript files
    Generation of single-page EPS files
    Creating lines/circles etc.
    Rectangles and boxes
    Text
    Colour
    Pre-defined paper sizes
    Etc. etc.

A module that provides compatibility with the GD module calls might also one day
be written, so that programs may be easily be converted to produce PostScript.
Don't hold your breath.

The file examples/example.pl provides some bad examples of what this module does.

Changes from 0.04: Watch Out! Several functions now have options passed by hash
reference, rather than the method used before. Your programs might break!
This way is a lot tidier... sorry if this caused any problems.

For example, before:
  $p->box(10,10,20,20, 1);
  $p->text(15, 15, "Hello", 'right');
  $p->polygon("rotate=45", 1,1, 1,2, 2,2, 2,1, 1,1);

now:
  $p->box({filled=>1}, 10,10, 20,20);
  $p->text({align=>"right"}, 15,15, "Hello");
  $p->polygon({rotate=>45}, 1,1, 1,2, 2,2, 2,1, 1,1);

TO-DO / DONE LISTS:

Done:

  landscape seems to work ok
  xsize and ysize set fine
  colour option works
  clipping works
  eps option works (but output needs slight modification save/restore etc)
  page option works. setpage allows page number/name to be changed
  bb[xy][12] options are in and set
  lines, circles and boxes work. functions only added when needed.
  setcolour function works. colour look-up table added.
  postscript DSC headers seem to be fine (for PS and EPS)
  colour->grey calculation (tested: this is actually ok)
  different line widths
  polygon function
  text and font functions
  paper sizes defined and used (DSC comment added)
  better error reporting (postscript comments still?)
  font encoding for european etc.
  add dd cc and sp to units
  text rotate / align
  import eps files into the postscript
  pie slices / arcs (well, arcs anyway)

To-Do:

  PostScript "compression", i.e. /n {newpath} bind def
  code compression using single letter dictionary defs (optional?)
  any postscript optimisation that can be done?
  hope that units are now correct... check
  postscript font support?
  define shape functions
  translate / scale / rotate functions?
  generate PostScript using a stack, rather than writing
    to the end of a text variable? could lead to some rather
    neat stuff (loops etc)
  different line styles (dashes)? (easy)
  ttf font support (get lost!)
